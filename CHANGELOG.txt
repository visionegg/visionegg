  - Removed old CVS cruft from VisionEgg/PyroClient.py VisionEgg/PyroHelpers.py

  - Fix trivial documentation bugs to have the correct version number.

  - Workaraound pygame/SDL issue when creating Font objects. (r1491, reported by Jeremy Hill)

  - bugfix: allow 4D as well as 3D vectors to specify vertices (r1472, r1474)

  - fix comments: improve description of coordinate system transforms (r1473)

  - Use standard Python idiom (r1475)

  - Further removal of 'from blah import *' (r1476, r1501)

  - Minor performance improvement (r1486)

  - update license to mention other code (r1502)

Changes for 1.1:
----------------

* Explicitly require Python 2.3 by removing duplicate of Python
  standard library's logging module and assume the "True" and "False"
  are defined. There were probably other assumptions depending on 2.3
  creeping into the code, as well.

* Removed Lib3DS module.

* Workaround PyOpenGL 3.0.0a and 3.0.0b1 bug in glLoadMatrixf().

* Fix SphereMap.AzElGrid() to properly draw iso elevation and azimuth
  lines at specified intervals.

* Change to use numpy at the core instead of Numeric. (Require numpy,
  no longer require Numeric.)

* Require setuptools

* No longer supporting Python 2.2

* Update Textures to accept numpy arrays as data source (by Martin Spacek)

* Update to work with PyOpenGL 3

* Changes so to reflect standard idioms on Python project layouts:
    - src/ directory renamed to VisionEgg/
         (but .c files need to be moved back to src/)
    - use 'package_data' distutils argument
  This enables setuptools to work with the Vision Egg.

* QuickTime movies work in Windows (need to check on OS X).

* FilledCircle stimulus is now anti-aliased. Thanks to Peter Jurica
  and Gijs Plomp.

* Added demo/texture3D_alpha.py

Changes for 1.0:
----------------

* Major enhancements to the ephys server/GUI code to use normal (or
  slightly modified) demo scripts in this environment were done by Imran
  Ali and Lachlan Dowd in the lab of David O'Carroll at the University
  of Adelaide.

* An initial patch for stereo support sent by Yuichi Sakano and Kevin
  J. MacKenzie at York University.

* Parallel port enhancements by Hubertus Becker, University of
  Tübingen.

* Arrow and FilledCircle stimuli by Hubertus Becker, University of
  Tübingen.

* DaqKeyboard and ResponseControl by Hubertus Becker, University of Tübingen.

* Full screen anti-aliasing support (FSAA) by Mark Halko, Boston
  University.

* Various patches by Tony Arkles (University of Saskatchewan),
  including a suggestion to separate camera motions from the
  GL_PROJECTION matrix and put them in the GL_MODELVIEW matrix, where
  they belong.

* Patch for VISIONEGG_SYSTEM_DIR by Nick Knouf, MIT.

* Added win32_vretrace.WaitForRetrace() (but it's not used for much,
  yet)

* Enhancements to EPhys Server/GUI sequencer

* Added 'lat-long rectangle' to available 3D masking windows

* Moved controller.CONSTANTS into FlowControl module namespace

* Numerous bugfixes

All code written for the 0.9.3 release should continue to run on the 0.9.4 release.  (There may be some slight changes in functionality due to bug fixes.)

Changes for 0.9.3:
------------------

MAJOR: Added .3ds file support to load 3D models.

MAJOR: Added Labview code to control gratings in a new "contrib"
package. Thanks Jamie Theobald!

Fixed texture-resizing bug.

Added Rectangle3D stimulus class.

Further refined log printing and other small enhancements.

Changes for 0.9.2:
------------------

MAJOR: GUI enhancements.

Maximum priority (with various options) can be set on Mac OS X and
win32.

Frame swap sync with vertical retrace support added to Mac OS X.

Friendly binary installer for Mac OS X, especially useful since now
Mac OS X code requires compilation.

Added SYNC_SWAP, RECORD_TIMES, HIDE_MOUSE, and FRAMELESS_WINDOW
options.

Textures now use mipmaps by default.

Minor: Improvements to check-config.py

Changes for 0.9.1:
------------------

Windows demos now distributed in standalone directory that does not
require python installation.

TCPServer mode can print current state, prints command summary, has
help, minor bugfixes.

Lots of little GUI adjustments, including automatic pop-up of
exception dialog box.

check-config.py detects old version.

Changes for 0.9.0:
------------------

MAJOR: Overall quality of code and base feature set now approaching
1.0 status.

MAJOR: Parameter control over TCP interface implemented using
TCPController class.

MAJOR: Triggering, both out and in, (re)implemented.  Same for other
data acquisition.

MAJOR: Gratings module, with SinGrating2D and SinGrating3D (with
perspective distortion) added.

MAJOR: Support for SGI IRIX now added.

MAJOR: Support for variable size (including 10 bits per channel) frame
buffers added.

MAJOR: Support for gamma table setting (including greater than 8 bit)
added. (Requires pygame 1.5.)

MAJOR: ``Run forever'' mode added.

MAJOR: Type-checking implemented for parameters under realtime
control. Complete re-design and re-implementation of realtime
controllers.

MINOR: Too many to list!

Changed license to LGPL from GPL.

Changes for 0.8.2:
------------------
MAJOR: Added frame-by-frame control with realtime_frame_contoller.
(Also renamed realtime_controller to realtime_time_controller.)  Make
sure you set your OpenGL driver to swap buffers at vertical retrace
sync if you use this feature!

Added support for on-screen text though VisionEgg.Text module.
Bitmapped text works pretty well, stroke fonts have a few issues still.

Must specify units for stimulus duration, either seconds or frames.

Created new module PlatformDependent, which houses all the platform
dependent C code.  Re-enabled setting of maximum priority (on linux,
at least).

Made lower_left and size attributes of Viewport class part of
parameters, so now they can be changed in realtime.

Added automatic detection of all extensions in tests/opengl_info.py.

Removed data acquisition stuff from distribution until I get time to
get it working again.

Re-incorporated linux (and other unix?) kernel scheduler maximum
priority stuff.

Re-incorporated collection and printing of frame-timing
statistics. Turn on by setting "collect_timing_info" argument of
Presentation.go() to non-zero value.

Contrast control in SpinningDrum now acheived with standard OpenGL
texture environment functions, not OpenGL extension.

Changes for 0.8.1:
------------------

Fixed some Mac OS X glitches.

Removed Overlay class from VisionEgg.Core.  (The Overlay class was the
same as the Stimulus class with the inclusion of its own projection.
Now, if your stimulus has an associated projection, as 2D stimuli
would, you must keep track of that yourself.)

Support for specifying the order in which stimuli are drawn added by
draw_order argument to the add_stimulus method of the Viewport class.
(Necessary to ensure any graphics that must get drawn on top of
everything else can be drawn last.)

Added remove_stimulus method to Viewport class.  Added remove
controller methods to Presentation class.

Improved auto-setting of video modes.

Added GetKeypressDialog and ToplevelDialog classes to GUI module.

Changes for 0.8.0:
------------------

MAJOR: Implemented new Screen, Viewport, Stimulus, Overlay, and
Presentation classes in VisionEgg.Core to more cleanly separate
components and allow multiple viewports on same screen.

MAJOR: Implemented new Parameters class in VisionEgg.Core to allow
more flexible control of any parameters which may change during or
between stimulus presentations.  This paves the way for easy control
using any imaginable means, including a local window, a remote python
script (see below about Pyro), or from a data-acquisition card.

MAJOR: Added remote execution methods, so now you can run the
VisionEgg in fullscreen mode while controlling it from a different
computer.  Check out the the demos in the demo/Pyro directory.
Requires python package "Pyro" (Python Remote Objects).

New configuration system added.  VisionEgg.config holds system-wide
configuration defaults.

Changed VisionEgg.py to Core.py, so now you must do "import
VisionEgg.Core".

Moved demo scripts into 'demo' directory within the main package.  Now
there is only one package to maintain.

Pulled texture stuff into Textures.py.

Pulled data acquisition stuff into Daq.py

Added lots of docstrings.

Created this changelog.

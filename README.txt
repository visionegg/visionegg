Welcome to the Vision Egg!

INSTALLATION

To install from source, type this from a command line (as root, if
necessary) from the Vision Egg base directory:

python setup.py install

However, the above assumes all of the prerequisites are working.  For
blow-by-blow accounts of how I got the prerequisites for the Vision
Egg installed on all the supported platforms, check out the website at
http://www.visionegg.org/

RUN THE CONFIGURATION CHECK (BEFORE AND/OR AFTER INSTALLATION)

Check for pre-requisites on your system by running check-config.py.
This can be run before or after installation of the Vision Egg, and
also displays useful information about the Vision Egg, if already
installed.

DEMOS, DOCUMENTATION, ETC.

The demos are no longer installed, but they are included with the
source code and the demo packages.

See the README-DEMOS.txt file in those packages.

The documentation start page is doc/index.html
